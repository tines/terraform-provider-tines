# Tines Provider

The Tines provider is used to interact with resources supported by Tines. 
The provider needs to be configured with the proper credentials before it can be used. 

## Upgrading Versions
Because the Tines Terraform provider is still under active development, breaking changes
may occur in minor versions for any 0.x.x release. Future stable versions (1.x.x and above)
will follow SemVer principles for backwards compatibility in minor and patch version updates.

Be sure to read the version upgrade guides to understand any breaking changes before upgrading.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
    required_providers {
      tines = {
        source = "tines/tines"
        version = "~> 0.2.0"
      }
    }
}

provider "tines" {
    tenant = "https://example.tines.com"
    api_key = var.tines_api_key
}

# Create a Tines Story
resource "tines_story" "example_story" {
    #
}
```
